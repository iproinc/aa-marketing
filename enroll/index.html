                    The 8-Week Live Mentorship sessions with Fred Lam are scheduled to be on Wednesday at 9PM EST. The first week will start on January 9th at 9PM EST. If you cannot make it to the live coaching sessions due to time zone difference or prior commitments, we got you covered! Each week’s session will be recorded and uploaded to the member’s area for easy access. If you are unable to make it to the live session, and you have a question directly for Fred Lam, please email it to our team at support@adtrics.com and we will get Fred to answer them live.
                    <br><br>
                    However, Fred wants you to be coachable to show your dedication and commitment. If you are an overachiever, and a person who is fully coachable to master the most valuable skill set of media buying, you should not make any excuses not to be live on the call with Fred.

                    The answer is simple. If you are already looking for the refund policy, then we encourage you NOT to join Adtrics Academy. You’re already in the mindset of not being able to be coachable and not believing that you can do it. What you’re about to master in Adtrics Academy is a decade worth of knowledge and millions of media buying spend to acquire. You can surely do these all yourself, but it will take you 10x the price and 10x the time to do so. That said, we are strict with our ‘No-Refund’ Policy. Remember, you’re getting enrolling into a 8-week LIVE mentorship and get direct coaching from Fred Lam himself. It’s like if you scheduled an appointment with a consultant. You can’t just ask for a refund after they have spent time with you. In fact, for Adtrics Academy, Fred Lam is spending 8 weeks with you! However, there is a 3-day cancellation policy in place. If you think that Adtrics Academy is not for you, you have up to 3 business days from the purchase date to cancel your membership and get a full refund. For cancellation request, please email support@adtrics.com.

                    You will get access to all of Adtrics Academy with your investment to the program. There will be no additional selling to you. Since this is a Media Buyer Certification Program, when you implement what you’ve learned into your business, you will certainly need to invest in online advertising, as well as other resources such as a website, domain, and any types of outsource work that you’ll need. Inside Adtrics Academy, you’ll also learn Fred Lam’s B.S. framework to start your business even if you have a limited budget and still can potentially become a 6-figure earner. Which framework you choose is up to you.
